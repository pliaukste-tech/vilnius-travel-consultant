DESCRIPTION: This section details the process of signing in to Streamlit Community Cloud via GitHub, including authorizing the Streamlit Community Cloud OAuth application and connecting to repositories.

SOURCE: https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/create-your-account

LANGUAGE: HTML
CODE:
```
Click "Continue with GitHub."
Enter your GitHub credentials, and follow GitHub's authentication prompts.
This adds the "Streamlit Community Cloud" OAuth application to your GitHub account. This application is only used to pass your email when you sign in to Community Cloud. On the next page, you'll perform additional steps to allow Community Cloud to access your repositories. For more information about using and reviewing the OAuth applications on your account, see Using OAuth apps in GitHub's docs.
Fill in your information, and click "Continue " at the bottom.
The "Primary email" field is prefilled with the email you used to sign in. If you change this email in the account setup form, it will only impact marketing emails; it will not reflect on your new account. To change the email associated with your account after it's created, see Update your email address.

TITLE: Streamlit App Execution Flow
DESCRIPTION: Explains the lifecycle of a Streamlit app, from initial script execution to handling user interactions and reruns. It highlights how Streamlit redraws output live and uses caching and session state for efficiency.

SOURCE: https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/fundamentals/summary

LANGUAGE: Python
CODE:
```
1. Streamlit apps are Python scripts that run from top to bottom.
2. Every time a user opens a browser tab pointing to your app, the script is executed and a new session starts.
3. As the script executes, Streamlit draws its output live in a browser.
4. Every time a user interacts with a widget, your script is re-executed and Streamlit redraws its output in the browser.
   * The output value of that widget matches the new value during that rerun.
5. Scripts use the Streamlit cache to avoid recomputing expensive functions, so updates happen very fast.
6. Session State lets you save information that persists between reruns when you need more than a simple widget.
7. Streamlit apps can contain multiple pages, which are defined in separate `.py` files in a `pages` folder.
